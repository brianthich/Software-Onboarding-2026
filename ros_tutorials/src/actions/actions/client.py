# Assignment: Create a ROS 2 Action That Sleeps for a Given Amount of Time
# In this exercise, you will build a client node that sends a goal to the sleep
# action server. The client requests a duration to wait, then receives periodic
# feedback while the server is sleeping and a final result once the task is done.
#
# The exercise introduces the basic ROS 2 action client pattern:
# - create a custom node class that inherits from rclpy.node.Node
# - initialize the node with a unique name
# - create an action client with self.create_client(...)
# - send a goal containing the requested duration
# - wait for feedback and the final result
# - log the result and status updates
#
# This file is the client half of the exercise. It sends a goal to the action
# server and processes the returned feedback/result. Together, these two nodes
# demonstrate how ROS 2 actions support long-running tasks with progress updates.

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from rclpy.action import ActionClient
from interfaces.action import SleepFor

# Action design:
#   Goal: seconds (float64)
#   Result: success (bool)
#   Feedback: remaining (float64)
# 
# Here, import SleepFor from the interfaces.action module
# SleepFor is the custom action type.

# ROS 2 boilerplate pattern:
# 1. Import rclpy and the base Node class.
# 2. Create a custom node class that inherits from Node.
# 3. In __init__, call super().__init__("node_name") to register the node.
# 4. Add action servers, publishers, subscribers, timers, and other ROS interfaces in __init__.
# 5. In main(), initialize rclpy, create the node, then make request to server and wait for result.
#    Finally destroy the node and shutdown ROS.
#
# This pattern is the standard starting point for most ROS 2 Python nodes.
